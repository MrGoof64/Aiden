    <h1>Skills</h1>

    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>So far, I have taken one Python class and have since learned the basics of the program, plus 
        more. I understand the fundamentals of the language and how it works, like how it requires the 
        user to indent code for it to function, and how it can create variables on the fly. I have worked 
        with and understand if-then statements, loops, and running a mainframe. 
    </p>

    <h2>Programming Logic</h2>
    <p>This is where I have learned most of my knowledge about programming, as well as how to make 
        efficient pseudocode. In programming logic I have learned how to define variables, run 
        calculations, format and modularize code, if-then statements, conditional operators, loops like for 
        and while, and mainframe creation.
    </p>

    <h2>Webpage Development</h2>
    <p>You mightâ€™ve been able to guess, but I can create websites using Html. This includes an 
        understanding of the basic syntax that is required to make them work, but also how to format a 
        webpage using CSS. This website serves as a visual for what I have learned, as every page is 
        designed and styled in Html and CSS.
